**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 5:June 8, Saturday

** Today's Progress **: I worked on hashing based problems and sliding window based problems which use the principle of carry forward.

** Thoughts ** : I did not do much work during the mid day. I take quite some time to start working after coming home from the gym because of having a bath, getting stuff for mom from the shop and having the urge to rest for some time. I started working late in the evening. I have to improve my performance. **

### Day 7: June 10, Monday

** Today's Progress: I worked an pattern matching algorithms. I tried to understadn the Manacher's. I sort of understood the algorithm but I was not even confident enough to try and code it up. I workded on Rabin Karp algorithm but spend a lot of time on it because I had to use double hashing. At last I read the notes to know how to implement it. I later started working on teh InfyTQ courses because I thought an 8lpa salary as a backup is a good thing and the things that are being taught in the courses is also useful for the placements.

** Thoughts ** : I am spending a lot of time on a particular problem. I not able to solve the problems without any help or reference.
 I was confused if me deciding on not doing an internship will impact me negativly. But I have to use this time effectivly to help me secure a good placement. I started working on the infosys courses and I will get infosys certified and get a job offer and think about it later.
