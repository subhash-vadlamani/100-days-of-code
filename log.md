##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 5:June 8, Saturday

** Today's Progress **: I worked on hashing based problems and sliding window based problems which use the principle of carry forward.

** Thoughts ** : I did not do much work during the mid day. I take quite some time to start working after coming home from the gym because of having a bath, getting stuff for mom from the shop and having the urge to rest for some time. I started working late in the evening. I have to improve my performance. **

1. [Count distinct elements in every window of size k] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-distinct-elements-in-every-window-of-size-k/)
